# Support

1. **Before requesting support**, please review the issues on our [GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/magicoli/opensim-helpers/issues?q=is%3Aissue). Your answer might already be there.

2. **If you didn't find an answer on the Issues page**, preferably [use GitHub to submit an issue](https://github.com/{{github_user}}/{{repo}}/issues/new). GitHub Issues are shared with the community so you might get help faster.

3. **Otherwise**, use the form below.

In all cases, make sure to include relevant details of your setup (project version, operating system, OpenSimulator version, php version, ...).

### Submit a Support Request

_The form is sent privately to the maintainers of the project. If they feel it is of public interest, they might publish your request (with personal data redacted) on GitHub Issues page and ask you to follow up from there._
